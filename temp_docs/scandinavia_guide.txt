# Scandinavia and Nordic Countries Guide

Scandinavia and the Nordic region are historical and geographical regions covering much of Northern Europe. Extending from above the Arctic Circle to the North and Baltic Seas, the Scandinavian Peninsula is the largest peninsula in Europe.

Popular tourist destinations Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and on occasion, Greenland, all make up the Nordic countries. As a whole, Scandinavia has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world and is enriched with its own culture and way of life.

The best time to visit Nordic countries is during summer when they have long daylight hours. Northern Norway and Finland experience almost no darkness during June and July. The winter months are ideal for seeing the Northern Lights due to less light pollution.

Languages spoken in the region include Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese. Each country has its own currency, with Denmark using the Danish krone, Finland using the Euro, Norway using the Norwegian krone, Sweden using the Swedish krona, and Iceland using the Icelandic krona.
